# -Spam-Detection-System
## 🔍 Email Spam Classifier 📧⚡ 
A machine learning-based system that detects spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression. This project utilizes TF-IDF vectorization, advanced feature engineering, and a robust classification pipeline to filter out unwanted emails. Deployed on Render for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time Spam Detection – Instantly classifies emails as Spam or Ham
✅ Advanced Feature Engineering – Extracts word count, sentence count, stopwords, digit presence, and character count for better accuracy
✅ Machine Learning Model – Uses Logistic Regression with TF-IDF for reliable predictions
✅ Handles Imbalanced Data – Utilizes SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for dataset balancing
✅ Deployable System – Hosted online using Render, accessible via API or UI
✅ Secure & Scalable – Ready for integration into email filtering applications

## 🔮 Future Improvements

🔹 Enhance model performance with Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers)
🔹 Improve dataset with real-world email spam collections
🔹 Deploy a Streamlit-powered user interface for easy classification
🔹 Implement API-based integration for email clients
